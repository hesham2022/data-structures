- Circular Linked List

### Stack
- Array-based stack
- Linked list-based stack

### Queue
- Array-based queue
- Linked list-based queue
- Circular queue
- Priority queue

### Hash Table

These are some of the commonly known data structures and their variations. It's important to note that data structures can often be combined or extended to create more advanced or specialized structures based on specific requirements. Additionally, new data structures can be designed to address unique scenarios and optimize particular operations.
